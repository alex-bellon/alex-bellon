## Hey, I'm Alex :wave:

I'm a CS PhD student at UC San Diego interested in security and privacy, cryptography, and open source. I recently graduated from UT Austin with my CS and Mathematics degrees, and last summer I interned at Mozilla as a Security Engineering Intern working on [package manager security](https://github.com/mozilla-services/dependency-observatory).

Here's some other stuff that I do:

- [Graphic design](https://alex-bellon.com/art) and [photography](https://alex-bellon.com/photography)
- Endlessly tweak my [dotfiles](https://github.com/alex-bellon/dotfiles)
- Experiment with and develop for my [homelab](https://github.com/alex-bellon/homelab)
- Gather resources for learning about [CTFs and security](https://github.com/alex-bellon/cybersecurity-resources)

And here's some stuff that I used to do:

- [Wrote CTF problems](https://github.com/alex-bellon/ctf-challenges) and [gave talks](https://github.com/alex-bellon/talks) about security topics with [@utisss](https://github.com/utisss) (we're the team behind [UTCTF](https://github.com/utisss/UTCTF-20))
- Participated in [CCDC](https://www.nationalccdc.org/) and [CPTC](https://www.nationalcptc.org/) with [@UT-CTF](https://github.com/UT-CTF)
- Competed in CTFs with [@utcoalition](https://github.com/utcoalition)
