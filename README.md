I'm a CS PhD student at UC San Diego interested in security and privacy, cryptography, and open source. I recently graduated from UT Austin with my CS and Mathematics degrees, and last summer I interned at Mozilla as a Security Engineering Intern working on [package manager security](https://github.com/mozilla-services/dependency-observatory).
